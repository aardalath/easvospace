NAME
    eas_qry - EAS_Query class from package eas

DESCRIPTION
    This module incorporates almost without modification the code provided
    by the ESDC Euclid team to preform am asynchronous query to the archives
    via TAP+ interface.
    
    Usage:
        The sequence of commands to perform a query would be
         1. Create the EAS_Query object
         2. Define the query with the ``setQuery()`` method
         3. Call the ``run()`` method, checking if the result is ``True``
         4. Retrieve the results with the ``results()`` method
    
        Please, have a look at the file ``query_and_save_to_vospace.py'' script for
        an example.  This example can be executed with::
    
            $ python query_and_save_to_vospace.py

CLASSES
    builtins.object
        EAS_Query
    
    class EAS_Query(builtins.object)
     |  Main class to encapsulate query jobs for EAS
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Initialize object (class instance) attributes.
     |  
     |  exit_info(self)
     |      Return exit information in case the run() method reported a failure.
     |  
     |  results(self)
     |      Returns the results from the last query executed.
     |  
     |  results_as_fits_table(self, header=None)
     |      Takes the CSV results, saves them in a temp. dile, and then retrieves
     |      the entire content.
     |  
     |  run(self)
     |      Launch the last defined query.  The execution is done in a separate thread.
     |  
     |  runUntilFinished(self)
     |      Performs the monitoring of the query requested, and retrieves the
     |      results for later use.
     |  
     |  save_results_as_csv(self, file_name)
     |      Takes results, already as CSV data, and store them in a local file
     |  
     |  save_results_as_fits_table(self, file_name, header=None)
     |      Takes the CSV results, convert them to an ascii.table.Table and outputs
     |      a pyfits.hdu.table.BinTableHDU, creating a blank header if no header
     |      is provided.  The result is stored in a FITS file.
     |  
     |  setQuery(self, adqlQry, name='myQuery', desc='This is my query')
     |      Define the query.  Multiple definitions are possible, but when run()
     |      is invoked, only the last one will be launched.
