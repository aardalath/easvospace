Help on module vos_handler:

NAME
    vos_handler - EAS_Query class from package eas

DESCRIPTION
    This module incorporates almost without modification the code provided
    by the ESDC Euclid team to store some content in a folder/file in the
    user VOSpace account.
    
    Usage:
        The sequence of commands to perform a query would be
         1. Create the VOSpace_Push object
         2. Call the ``save_to_file`` method to store something in a
            VOSpace folder/file
    
        Please, have a look at the file ``query_and_save_to_vospace.py'' script for
        an example.  This example can be executed with::
    
            $ python query_and_save_to_vospace.py
